# Churn & Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – Demo Project

This repository contains a small, self-contained demo showing how to:

- Analyse **customer churn** for a subscription-like business.
- Estimate **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** from transactional data.
- Combine churn and CLV to support **data-driven retention and marketing decisions**.

It is designed as an interview / portfolio project: you can walk someone through the notebooks in ~30–45 minutes to demonstrate your thinking.
